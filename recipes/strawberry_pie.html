    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Strawberry Pie recipe is a delightful dessert made with fresh strawberries. It starts with a baked pie crust, which serves as the base. Next, half of the strawberries are arranged inside the crust. The remaining strawberries are cooked with sugar to create a thick, sweet strawberry filling.</p>
    <p>This cooked mixture is then poured over the fresh berries in the crust. The pie is then chilled until set, typically for at least 3 hours. Just before serving, a dollop of whipped cream is added to each slice. The result is a refreshing and fruity pie that celebrates the sweetness of ripe strawberries.</p>
