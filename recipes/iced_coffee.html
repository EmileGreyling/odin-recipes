        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Iced Coffee is a refreshing and straightforward beverage that's
            perfect for coffee enthusiasts looking to enjoy their favorite drink
            chilled. The recipe typically involves brewing a strong pot of
            coffee and allowing it to cool. Once cooled, the coffee is poured
            over a glass full of ice cubes. To sweeten the drink, one can add
            sugar, flavored syrups, or even condensed milk according to taste.
            For a creamier texture, milk or cream is stirred in, creating a rich
            and smooth coffee experience. This simple yet delightful drink is
            ideal for hot days or as an afternoon pick-me-up.
