        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Apple Pie recipe is absolutely delicious! It begins with a
            flaky pie crust, which serves as both the base and the top layer.
            Inside, peeled and sliced cooking apples are combined with sugar,
            flour, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The mixture is then placed in the pie
            crust, and butter is added for richness. The top crust is sealed,
            brushed with beaten egg, and baked until golden brown. The result is
            a warm, comforting apple pie that pairs perfectly with crème
            fraîche, vanilla ice cream, or natural yogurt. It's a timeless treat
            for any occasion!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>

                Combine 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add more
