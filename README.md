# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my basic recipe website! In this project, I've built a simple site with HTML to display various recipes. While it won't look fancy, it's a great way to practice HTML skills. Later, we'll style it up with CSS.

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTML Structure: Creating well-organized web pages.
- Linking Pages: Connecting different recipe pages.
- Basic Web Layout: Arranging content on the page.
